## Cod Time Series Project

For FISH 546 class, I will be using RAD data from a cod project looking for genetic differentiation between larval cohorts of Pacific cod. Pacific cod no longer occur in Puget Sound, and Puget Sound was always the southern limit of the range. One hypothesis about why they are no longer in Puget Sound is that the water is warming and it is now too warm for cod. Looking for genetic differentiation would be a first step in testing this hypothesis.

A collaborator in our lab produced this data and will give it to me next week.

This repository will store my data, scripts, analyses, and workbooks for the project.
